### Hi there üëã

I am currently working as a Data Scientist [@CarbonPlan](https://carbonplan.org/).
I previously worked as a postdoctoral researcher for the [University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/)
and a scientist for the federal government :technologist:. I
completed a PhD in geological oceanography, researching underwater volcanoes, at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program :volcano:
